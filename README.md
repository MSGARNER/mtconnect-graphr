mtconnect-graphr
================

A Web Based Utility to monitor an MTConnect Stream.The project was undertaken as a case study to understand how easy (or difficult) it may be for a novice to pickup MTConnect concepts.

Currently the Application can:
-- Connect to an MTConnect Agent
-- Detect multiple machines in a single stream
-- Display Alarm States
-- Monitor various parameters
-- Plot one parameter in time
-- Display Red/Green emergency state for the same parameter
-- For more information about the project, contact hiprincearora [at] gmail.com

How to use:
- Fire up the application by opening index.htm
- Enter the link to the MTConnect agent stream in the white popup (without the 'http://' prefix)
- The application will populate the name of the machines found in the stream
- Click on the machine you would like to monitor
- To check out various conditions, click on 'conditions' within the scroll which comes up
- Click the radio button beside the parameter you want to be plotted
- Select the limits for the parameter and click on submit to monitor it with the help of a red/green signal
